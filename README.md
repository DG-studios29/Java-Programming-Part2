Task 1: Java Basics
An introduction to the basic syntax, data types, and structures of the Java programming language.

Task 2: Data Structures
An exploration of Java's core data structures, including arrays, lists, and other collections.

Task 3: Methods
In-depth understanding of defining and using methods to modularize code.

Task 4: Java Text I/O
This task covers reading and writing text files using Java's I/O classes.

Task 5: Object-Oriented Programming
This task introduces core OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Task 6: Advanced OOP
An advanced look at OOP with concepts such as abstraction, interfaces, and inner classes.

Task 7: Capstone Project I - OOP
A project where OOP concepts were applied to build a complete program demonstrating class hierarchies and object relationships.

Task 8: Recursion
An introduction to recursive algorithms, where functions call themselves to solve problems.

Task 9: Towards Defensive Programming II
This task focuses on writing robust code that anticipates and prevents errors through defensive techniques.

Task 10: Refactoring
An exercise in improving the structure and readability of existing code without changing its behavior.

Task 11: Capstone Project II - Putting It All Together
A comprehensive project combining all learned Java concepts into a cohesive, functional application.

Task 12: Java Collections Framework
A detailed look into Java's Collections Framework, including Lists, Sets, Maps, and their implementations.

Task 13: Hashing Algorithms
An exploration of hashing algorithms and their implementation in Java for fast lookups.

Task 14: Computer Science Fundamentals and Big O Notation
A deep dive into algorithm analysis, time complexity, and Big O notation to evaluate code performance.

Task 15: Build Your Brand II
Focuses on personal branding and building an online portfolio or presence for career development.

Task 16: Version Control IV - Pipelines
Introduction to automated pipelines and continuous integration (CI) processes using Git.

Task 17: Containers - Docker
Covers Docker and containerization, enabling the packaging of applications for consistent deployment across environments.

Task 18: Software Documentation
Focuses on the importance of software documentation, writing clear instructions, and generating helpful guides for users and developers.
